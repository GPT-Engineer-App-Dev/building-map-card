I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI text-based model, I'm unable to create or implement image files such as PNGs. However, I can guide you through the process of creating a pin icon using a graphic design software or provide you with a description of how it might look.

If you want to create a pin icon, you can follow these general steps using a software like Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or any other vector graphic design tool:

1. Open your graphic design software and create a new document.
2. Use the ellipse tool to draw a circle that will form the top of the pin.
3. Below the circle, draw a rectangle that will form the body of the pin.
4. Use the pen tool or a similar tool to create a sharp point at the bottom of the rectangle, completing the pin shape.
5. Adjust the proportions of the circle and the pointed rectangle to resemble a typical map pin icon.
6. Apply a fill color to the pin shape, typically red or another bright color to make it stand out as a location marker.
7. Optionally, add a white stroke or shadow to the pin to enhance its visibility against different map backgrounds.
8. Save your design as a PNG file with a transparent background for use in various applications.

Remember, this is just a textual description, and you would need to use actual graphic design software to create the image file. If you need a visual representation, you might consider hiring a graphic designer or using online resources that offer free or paid icon designs.
